We were staying in the **Resort Suite Confort** for one night to get acclimatized to the altitude. A very nice place and very lovely people. Arequipa has an elevation of 2335m and Cusco is even at an elevation of 3399m.

Arequipa is surrounded by two stunningly high Volcano's and the one which actually looks also like one is called **Misti** with an elevation of 5822m. The second one is called **Chachani** and has an elevation of unbelievable 6057m.
