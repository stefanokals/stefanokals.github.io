Taking the bus from Arequipa to Cusco with **Oltursa** was a really bad idea, but we wanted to know which company is in our experience better, but as I said before a really bad idea, 10h promissed, 12h taken, it smelled after pee, air condition did not work, seat in front of me was broken and the air was really sticky. We had for sure just a bad pick, but the better company per reviews on other sites also indicate that **Cruz del Sur** is just a level higher with comfort, quality, food and a great driving experience.

We will definitely stay with **Cruz del Sur** for our next bus trip. If there will be one.

After arriving, we had a worm welcome from Monica and Jorge, our host parents. They do speak spanish and just a tiny bit of english. Very hard for us, without any spanish language experience. But hey, thats how you learn a language, right?

Next on the calendar was a little sightseeing tour with the school for an hour. Meeting new people from the school and seeing some of the most interesting places in the center of the city of Cusco.
