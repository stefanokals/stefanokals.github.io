A fucking great time we are living in or something like that, a book named by Stephen Hawking. Okay I rechecked, in German it's called "A wonderful time to live / Eine wundervolle Zeit zu leben" uuups. So this will be a fucking great time to live in I agree, a reordering of the world and its economical basic principles. This virus shows how vulnerable we still are and that our economy is just a big pile of crap, globalization as it is and the dependency of other countries it seems as for now was a big mistake even with its great benefits it has brought us as well.

Today I read an article about the unconditional basic income, which I would love to see coming and would help during the crisis. There are other great benefits as well, for example the cleansing of the world, the co2 reduction, the electricity reduction, the better air quality we now have due to the standstill, so to be an optimist, well I am actually not, but as an optimist, those are all good things about the situation and the crisis we are in now beside of the unfortunate huge loses, we will encounter, but to be honest, without blaming someone or all at once, we were getting too super comfortable, that there would be no other way than something with an huge impact like a new world war or as it is now a pandemic virus which accomplishes a rethinking or a reordering. This might sound harsh or unmoralic, but isn't that what the world is? Strange laws, strange habbits, strange developments, strange moralic decisions, a steady battle we fight, a world of pain we are in, a future with no destiny, no believe, just the way of consumption which is our one true god? After this crisis perhaps we might open our minds and our thinking and hopefully create another bright future, after this crisis is over, with a new way of living. Globally spoken!

I am pretty sure, and as a pessimist, my guts and my stomach's speaking, I am pretty sure this kind of global economy will not survive or at least will be shaken to its foundations. The worldwide BIP would fall at about 0.5%, they told us 2 weeks ago, ridiculous number as it seems for now. Now we know for sure that most countries will fall in a depression and some of the biggest countries it seems will drop at around 10% at least. The virus has not yet even started to damage the masses yet (200'000 infections compared to 7'700'000'000 inhabitants) is not yet much so far.

I am not an economist, so don't blame me for wrong conclusions, but one thing I think is for sure, you don't need to be an economist to see that it will and already is hurting the one economy we built, which we thought would continue like this on and on to the infinite. But the environmental activist are right in that point, that endless resources and infinite growth is not possible at all. Thats a natural law, not some freaky bullshit superstitious thinking here. And the same shitty law, will happen to medical equipment and supplies, if all really goes down to the ground, but we all hope will not happen.

Unfortunately a lot of people still don't understand that if and only if lets say 40% (and they say 40-70%) will be infected, with a mortality of lets say optimistically only 1% (and they say 2-4%) that there will be a total of deaths in the future of 7'800'000'000 * 0.4 * 0.01 = 31'200'000. We can only hope that the mortality will decrease below 1% or a vaccine will be ready soon.

This talking might upset some of you, I am sorry for that, but I often argue with feelings, not with facts or logic, that's what my strength seems to be for, the rest can do others.

And if you are in a lockdown in a foreign country, you have the time to be angry, to write and shout it out in your room or a blog. Strange times we are living in, what?
