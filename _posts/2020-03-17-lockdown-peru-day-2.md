Here we are from day 2 during the 15 day lockdown in Peru. And it could be worse.

{% include gallery id="gallery" caption="The **window** view." %}

But what is the better alternative now? To return to an environment which we know and are used to, but is getting out of control of the virus or stay in a country we do not know the culture, the people, the government and authorities, but has reacted way quicker to prevent spreading the virus, but is uncertain what will happen next?

Due to the fact, that switzerland has not reacted yet or did not plan to repatriate people from here so this question does not arise anyway so far.

Another alternative is just staying calm and try to continue our trip after the 15 days period, when hopefully public transportation is back on track. Because flights are even longer restricted, with a total of 30 days, no flights will cross the border.

However beside all the praising of the government reacting that fast here in Peru, I don't get the point letting foreigners not returning to their home country, aren't they not the spreaders of the virus beside peruvians returning from visitting countries which already have a lot of infections?

I even don't get the point that all people even the ones who are not belonging to the risk group need to go through all this measures. It would be much more efficient, to let all the elderly and people with pre-existing illness stay in isolation or quarantine them, or am I missing something here? Probably I am anyway not qualified for questioning this, but it's in my head, and it had to get out.
