Now to some more beautiful things. We are here and we are allowed to get food and drugs. Thats how we can get out and get some pictures as well and at least a little experience. First of all, we feel the altitude of 3399m, I tend to breath like and old man, after 100m. Secondly Cusco is a very beautiful place, sad to not have the possibility to experience it in its total. Maybe I can get my drone operating, but I don't have a balcony to start it from and out of the window is a bit, difficult, and to go out in a park, seems to be a little bit problematic with all the police out there. Beside of that, the airport is around 1km away and I am pretty sure they have a restricted area as well around it. I need to recheck however. But honestly who gives a fuck, when no airplanes operate, hm? So no harm could be done anyway.
