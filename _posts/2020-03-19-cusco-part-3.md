Welcome again from beautiful Cusco.

We could tell you that we are on hard times here and this pictures would show the truth.

{% include gallery id="gallery" caption="A small part of Cusco." %}

But in fact its not the truth yet. This pictures where taken in a huge supermarket, where it seems that they have too much space for the products they have and the long line is just normal as peruvians go pay their electricity bill in that way.

But a good example how fast we could produce fake news. I was actually surprised how easy.

However this is the real situation as for now. Almost no people outside and a lot of stuff (including enough toilet paper *laugh*) for now.
