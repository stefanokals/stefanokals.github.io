Yesterday 15.3.2020 sunday night the government of peru, namely the president has decided to put peru in an emergency lockdown for at least 15 days. This means no people can enter anymore by bus, airplane or over other ways into the country, but more important, all people are now in quarantine and cannot leave the country as well. So no international flights from peru for the next 30 days it seems. All stores except for pharmacies and grocery stores are now closed. Not more than 15 minutes to go out and grab food or drugs. No busses to other places. And lot of people tell different things.

At the moment the situation is quite chaotic here and whole peru is in schock. We do have everything at the moment and a safe home, thanks to our host family Monica and Jorge. But in the worst case - I believe will sooner or later happen - that the situation will get out of control. In the best case, due to the quick reaction, compared to other european countries, they could flatten the curve and in two weeks everything will get back on track slowly. I doubt this will happen in Switzerland, but I hope for the sacke of all, I am wrong. But to be honest, even If I don't like the swiss military, I trust the swiss military and civil protection in switzerland more than the boys here in Peru, perhaps because I am a stranger in this country, and the black guy in Peru. I now can see the views of people and the worries they have to foreigners, first time I probably experience some sort of racism, but on a far lower level. But generally saying all people we met so far in peru are very polite and friendly.

I salute the government for doing such a drastic measure that early (around 80 confirmed covid-19 cases so far). Honestly I did not expect this to be happen in the next 3 weeks, so that we could go up north before a lockdown. The government was way quicker than our government at home. And best of all, today the swiss government (Bundesrat) announced that people should return home, and namely said, we call swiss people from abroad home, however we are not able to organize a flight back or anything else without the involvement of the swiss government the EDA or another authority which has the possibility to get us back. I called, the EDA, I wrote the embassy in Lima, wrote the consulate in Cusco. So far they all tell the same, no measures will take place, so we are on our own. Really? Is this what you guys in the top etages build for us, then thanks to that. A small virus which destroys the whole global economy. And thanks to you all for that you value money more than people.

It seems that some countries try to get there people back home, I heard about Belgium or Poland, but not sure if this is fact. I wish the swiss government would do the same. I would not care if they use military aircraft's for that.

I hope the internet does not get a flue as well, that's now the only place to socialize for the moment, thank you internet for once.
