When president Martin Vizcarra decided to close the borders on 16.3. all tourist are stuck inside peru. One day later he adjusted the law so that authorities from other countries, respectively other governments can arrange return flights.

Germany for example was able to arrange flights via KLM to Paris for the 20.3.2020, via the german embassy in Lima, Peru. And germany has spelled a 50'000'000 Euro for stranded germans to return safely. They even have developed a quick new site together with SAP in this short period of time to submit return requests, because the site <https://elefand.diplo.de/> is overloaded. I heard that 100'000 Germans are outside germany right now, and at least 4000 are stuck in Peru.

Until now we did not hear anything new from the swiss embassy or the swiss government, beside of what we can do and cannot. Only some news from the Tagesschau under <https://www.srf.ch>. Fortunately we both have an EU passport, which might help in case if the situation gets worse.

It is now allowed for governments to charter commercial flights with the new regulation, but this needs for sure some time. It would be much easier to go back to Europe from Lima, than from Cusco, because there are no direct flights to Europe from Cusco.

However compared to the situation in Europe or even Switzerland, the situation here in Peru is still under control. Only the drastic measures and the uncertainty about the future, the altitude or the food which is pure poisson for my stomach, makes it difficult to keep calm. A little sidenote, the food is wonderful and diverse, but the bacteria seem not to be friends with my stomach yet.

We both agree right now, to break up the trip, return safely, wait out the storm, and continue the trip later on if possible.
